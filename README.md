# Single Page Application for SuperHero API

# Description
This single-page application creates a graphical representation of the GitHub [SuperHero API](https://github.com/akabab/superhero-api.git). The application creates a character card for each character in the API and allows for partial match search using the find a character search bar. It also has filtering of characters based on the first letter of the character's name. 

# Project Status
This is a project for Flatiron Schools Software Engineering Bootcamp. I may try to improve it and add features at a future date for now development has slowed down.
